class MultiMock(object):
    """
    Context-managed multi-mock object. This is useful if you need to mock
    multiple things at once. So instead of creating individual patch+mock
    objects for each, you can define them basically as a dictionary. You can
    also use the mock context managers without having to nest `with`
    statements.

    Example usage:

    .. code-block:: python

        # First, define your mock targets as a dictionary.
        # The value of each item is the path to the function/method you wish to
        # mock. The key is basically a shortcut to the mock.
        mocks = {
            'touch': 'openquake.engine.logs.touch_log_file',
            'job': 'openquake.engine.engine.haz_job_from_file',
        }
        multi_mock = MultiMock(**mocks)

        # To start mocking, start the context manager using `with`:
        # with multi_mock:
        with multi_mock:
            # You can mock return values, for example, just as you would with
            # any other Mock object:
            multi_mock['job'].return_value = 'foo'

            # call the function under test which will calls the mocked
            # functions
            engine.run_hazard('job.ini', 'debug', 'oq.log', ['geojson'])

            # To test the mocks, you can simply access each mock from
            # `multi_mock` like a dict:
            assert multi_mock['touch'].call_count == 1
